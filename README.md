# Mapping Earthquakes
This project is meant to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. In addition, it is to highlight all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Finally, it is to present the data on a third map.

## What we are delivering:
This project starts can be initiated from the index.html file.
The default interface offers eartquake activities around the world and categorize them by order of magnitude. A color-coded legend widget, on the bottom right of the screen, qualifies each earthquake occurence.
Using a mouse a user may find more information of an earthquake. This information would list the magnitude and the precise location of the event.
Another widget, at the top right of the screen, offers a user options to customize the content of the screen. By default, the screens shows a street-level map of the globe with all earthquakes (major or minor) along with the tectonic plates. A statellite view and another layer are also available.
Finally, a user can customize this display by hovering over the option widget, right side of the screen, and view minor an/or major earthquakes and the tectonic plates.
